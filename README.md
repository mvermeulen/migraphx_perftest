Repository for running performance tests on MIGraphX

run.sh is the default run script.  Options are listed as comments in the script.

clean.sh is a script to cleanup temporary test results.  These can be useful
   for debugging and investigating issues, so this clean operation doesn't happen
   after every test run. Instead this script can be run if needed.
